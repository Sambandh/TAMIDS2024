# ðŸŒŠ Sea Level Rising!

Global Warming is one of the threats humanity faces where the consequences of the actions have a long term effects rather than immediate ones. 

Here, we try to understand the cause and impact of sea level rising, using different data analysis techniques. We also apply machine learning and deep learning models to predict the future behavior, alongside a possibility to look at the factors that can be controlled. Later, we also provide the audience with a metric about the scale of change of impact by controlling these factors. 

This data app shows a simple demonstration of an interactive data explorer that allow users to adjust parameter widgets and observe in real-time updates to data visualization.
